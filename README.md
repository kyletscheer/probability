# Independent Event Combination Probability Calculator
The Event Combination Probability Calculator is a web application that allows you to calculate probabilities for combinations of independent events. This calculator helps users understand the likelihood of various outcomes when multiple events occur independently of each other.

It also generates experiments using a random generator to demonstrate the combination probabilities in practice.

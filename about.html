      <h1>About the Calculator</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The
        <a href="index.html">Event Combination Probability Calculator</a>
        is a web application that allows you to calculate probabilities for
        combinations of independent events. This calculator helps users
        understand the likelihood of various outcomes when multiple events occur
        independently of each other.<br /><br />It also generates experiments
        using a random generator to demonstrate the combination probabilities in
        practice.
      </p>

      <h2>Probability Calculation</h2>
      <p>
        The probability of an event occurring is represented by a number between
        0 and 1, where 0 indicates impossibility, and 1 indicates certainty.
        When dealing with multiple independent events, the probability of their
        joint occurrence is calculated as the product of their individual
        probabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        For two independent events A and B, the probability of both events
        occurring is given by:
      </p>

      <div class="equation">\( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \)</div>
      <br />
      <p>
        For more than two events, the probability of all events \( A_1, A_2,
        ..., A_n \) occurring together is calculated as:
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \( P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap ... \cap A_n) = P(A_1) \times P(A_2) \times ...
        \times P(A_n) \)
      </div>
      <br />
      <h2>Combinations and Complementary Probability</h2>
      <p>
        The calculator generates all possible combinations of events and their
        corresponding probabilities using binary counting. Binary counting
        refers to an event occurring (1) or not occurring (0). For example, if
        we have three events A, B, and C, we can represent all possible
        combinations using binary digits as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>000 ~ \( P(\text{None}) = (1 - P(A))(1 - P(B))(1 - P(C)) \)</li>
        <li>001 ~ \( P(\text{C}) = P(C)(1 - P(A))(1 - P(B)) \)</li>
        <li>010 ~ \( P(\text{B}) = P(B)(1 - P(A))(1 - P(C)) \)</li>
        <li>011 ~ \( P(\text{B and C}) = P(B)P(C)(1 - P(A)) \)</li>
        <li>100 ~ \( P(\text{A}) = P(A)(1 - P(B))(1 - P(C)) \)</li>
        <li>101 ~ \( P(\text{A and C}) = P(A)P(C)(1 - P(B)) \)</li>
        <li>110 ~ \( P(\text{A and B}) = P(A)P(B)(1 - P(C)) \)</li>
        <li>111 ~ \( P(\text{A and B and C}) = P(A)P(B)P(C) \)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The calculator calculates the probability of each combination by
        multiplying the probabilities of the events that occur and the
        complement of the probabilities for the events that don't occur. The
        complement of the probability of an event \( A \) is \( (1 - P(A)) \).
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, to calculate the probability of events A and B occurring
        together while C, D, and E do not occur, you would use:
      </p>

      <div class="equation">
        \( P(A \cap B \cap \neg C \cap \neg D \cap \neg E) = P(A) \times P(B)
        \times (1 - P(C)) \times (1 - P(D)) \times (1 - P(E)) \)
      </div>
      <br />
      <h2>Experimental Results</h2>
      <p>
        The calculator runs a specified number of experiments to determine the
        likelihood of different combinations of events occurring.
      </p>

      <p>For each simulated experiment:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A random number is generated to simulate the element of chance.</li>
        <li>
          The calculator determines which combination of events occurs based on
          the generated random number and the theoretical probabilities.
        </li>
        <li>The occurrences of each combination are counted and recorded.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        After conducting all experiments, the experimental probabilities for
        each combination are calculated by dividing the number of occurrences by
        the total number of experiments.
      </p>

      <p>Here's an example:</p>

      <p>
        Suppose we have three events A, B, and C with probabilities \( P(A) =
        0.3, P(B) = 0.4, \) and \( P(C) = 0.2 \). The calculator runs 1000
        experiments and records the following occurrences:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          "A" occurred 150 times. \( P(\text{A}) = \frac{150}{1000} = Y \) (15%)
        </li>
        <li>
          "B" occurred 218 times. \( P(\text{B}) = \frac{218}{1000} = Y \)
          (21.8%)
        </li>
        <li>
          "C" occurred 86 times. \( P(\text{C}) = \frac{86}{1000} = Y \) (8.6%)
        </li>
        <li>
          "A and B" occurred 103 times. \( P(\text{A and B}) = \frac{103}{1000}
          = 0.103 \) (10.3%)
        </li>
        <li>
          "A and C" occurred 38 times. \( P(\text{A and C}) = \frac{38}{1000} =
          0.038 \) (3.8%)
        </li>
        <li>
          "B and C" occurred 64 times. \( P(\text{B and C}) = \frac{64}{1000} =
          0.064 \) (6.4%)
        </li>
        <li>
          "A, B, and C" occurred 23 times. \( P(\text{A and B and C}) =
          \frac{23}{1000} = 0.023 \) (2.3%)
        </li>
        <li>
          "None" occurred 318 times. \( P(\text{None}) = \frac{318}{1000} = Y \)
          (31.8%)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Using the Calculator</h2>
      <p>To use the Independent Events Probability Calculator:</p>
